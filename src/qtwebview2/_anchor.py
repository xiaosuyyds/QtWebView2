``_AnchorWindow`` — top-level transparent host for the WebView child HWND.

On Windows the window is made layered (per-pixel alpha via
``WS_EX_LAYERED``) so that resize events can fill newly-exposed pixels
with alpha=1 — eliminating the black-edge flicker that the DWM would
otherwise produce when the layered surface is extended during resize.

See the class docstring for a detailed rationale.

class _AnchorWindow(QWidget):
    """
    Top-level window that hosts the WebView child HWND.

    **Why this class exists**

    Windows WebView2 resizing produces a black-edge flicker.  The flicker
    comes from the DWM layered surface being extended before any new
    content is submitted — the DWM fills the new area with transparent
    black, which the user sees as a brief black flash at the window edge.

    The known fix is per-pixel alpha: fill every pixel of the layered
    surface with alpha=1 (visually transparent, but alpha>0 tells the
    DWM the pixel belongs to this window → hit-test passes).  Qt provides
    this via ``WA_TranslucentBackground`` + ``paintEvent``, but
    ``createWindowContainer`` suppresses *paintEvent* on the embedded
    window, so newly-exposed areas never receive the alpha=1 fill during
    resize.

    **How this class works around it**

    1. ``WA_TranslucentBackground`` — Qt creates the window with
       ``WS_EX_LAYERED`` and handles the *initial* layered surface setup.

    2. ``nativeEvent`` catches ``WM_SIZE`` — during a resize the window's
       layered surface is extended by the DWM (new area = alpha=0).  We
       immediately schedule (throttled) or directly call ``_fill_layered``
       which submits a fresh 32-bit BGRA bitmap via the Win32
       ``UpdateLayeredWindow`` API — bypassing Qt's paint machinery entirely.

    3. Throttling (~30 fps via ``_fill_timer``) — calling
       ``UpdateLayeredWindow`` on every ``WM_SIZE`` (which fires 60–120
       times/sec during a mouse drag) causes the DWM to re-composite the
       entire window each time, making the WebView content flicker.
       Throttling to ~30 fps reduces the flicker to an acceptable level
       while still updating quickly enough that the resize feels responsive.
       ``WM_EXITSIZEMOVE`` (0x0232) triggers an immediate final update.

    4. Cached DIB section — creating a new 32-bit bitmap on every call
       is wasteful.  We cache the GDI objects and only recreate them when
       the window grows beyond the cached size.

    5. The bitmap is filled with BGRA ``(0, 0, 0, 1)`` — premultiplied
       alpha where every pixel has alpha=1.  The DWM does per-pixel
       hit-testing: alpha>0 means the pixel belongs to this window, so
       clicks are registered even though the pixel is visually transparent
       (1/255 opacity).

    **Why not use ``WA_TranslucentBackground`` + ``repaint()``?**

    ``createWindowContainer`` stops ``paintEvent`` (and ``WM_PAINT``)
    from reaching the embedded window for newly-exposed areas.  Calling
    ``repaint()``, ``update()``, or even direct QPainter painting has no
    effect — Qt's internal foreign-window integration simply does not
    route those paint operations to the layered surface.  The only
    reliable path is to call ``UpdateLayeredWindow`` ourselves.
